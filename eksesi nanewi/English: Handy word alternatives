Hello, Vanege here. I try to speak Heli as much as possible.
When a word is unclear, me and my speaking partner try to find a better one.
I list our findings here. These alternatives tend to be clearer.
Obviously, these are just tips, you can try other words.
But at least these words were tested to work in real conversations.
