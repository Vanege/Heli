Introduction

Heli is an attempt to create the most inclusive language. The easiest language to learn for the median earthling. At the present time (2018), English is the most influential and studied language in the world. However, it is not inclusive: it has too many phonemes and it is not written like it is pronounced. The grammar can also be greatly simplified, following those of the most modern constructed auxiliary languages.

Heli is an original and pragmatic take on planned languages. A major part of language learning is memorizing a lot of words. This takes time, and people don't have that (even more if they are busy learning English). So let's not do that. Instead, Heli uses English words, that are regularly transformed using a simple set of rules. Most English words can become a valid Heli word, but some synonyms may be preferred by the community.

Heli is highly derivational, similarly to Esperanto, with part-of-speech endings and a prefix for opposites. This greatly reduces the number of words to learn, and allows creating new words with no direct equivalent in English.

Heli is ready to learn and already in use by a very small group of people in Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/EjukbkmivHgrInfX_5nJ4A



Alphabet
a e i o u
b d f g h k l m n p s t w y
They are all pronounced like in English, except for the vowels
a like pat
e like pet
i like pee
o like pope (but a pure sound, not a diphthong)
u like poop

Each vowel represents a syllable
onei -> o ne i

Stress on the first syllable
potatu -> POtatu

People who have trouble pronouncing consonant clusters can add virtual "ə" or "e". They must not be stressed.
musta -> "musəta"
landu -> "lanədu"

Nouns end with u
way -> wayu
human -> humanu

There are no indefinite article (a/an)
a kid -> kidu
a land -> landu

The, this and that are replaced with ti
this hand -> ti handu
the money -> ti moneyu

Importation and derivation
Derivation (you will learn this later) is often preferred over importation from English, since it reduces the number of collisions (words that end up being the same) and reduces the number of words to learn in order to achieve basic fluency. First, you will see the 15 rules of importation.

(1) Vowels (a/e/i/o/u) at the end are removed before adding an ending
time -> timu
a state -> statu
lifu -> lifu

(2) y at the end is removed when it does not follow a consonant
a body -> bodu
a wayu -> wayu
a family -> familu

(3) When a vowel (a/e/i/o/u) follows a vowel, only the first is kept
a season -> sesonu
a house -> hosu

(4) ph is replaced with f
a telephone -> telefonu
a philosophy -> filosofu

(5) h is removed when it follows a consonant
this thing -> ti tingu
the help -> ti helpu
that night -> ti nigtu

(6) c is replaced with k when it sounds like k
a fact -> faktu
music -> musiku

(7) c is replaced with s when it does not sound like k
a change -> sangu
this face -> ti fasu

(8) r is replaced with l
water -> watelu
a story -> stolu
the program -> ti ploglamu

(9) v is replaced with b
a level -> lebelu
love -> loba

(10) z is replaced with s
the magazine -> ti magasinu
a zebra -> seblu

(11) j is replaced with y
a jungle -> yunglu
a joke -> yoku

(12) q is replaced with k
a question -> kustinu
a technique -> tekniku

(13) x is replaced with ks
an exit -> eksitu
a tax -> taksu

(14) w is removed when l/r follows it
This is very rare, and synonyms will do the job. You will see later.

(15) When a consonant follows the same consonant, it is removed
coffee -> kofu
hello -> helu

Verbs in the active voice end with a. They are mostly based on the infinitive form. They don't change.
to say -> saya
to go -> ga

"to be" is "ba". It can be removed if the sentence stays understandable.
a human is an animal -> humanu ba animalu
the school is the house -> ti skolu ba ti hosu

Pronouns take the noun ending (u)
I -> mu ; you -> yu ; he/she/it -> hu
I have hope -> mu haba hopu
You say a thing -> yu saya tingu

Pronouns stay the same when they are objects
me -> mu ; you -> yu ; him/her/it -> hu
You can have it -> yu kana haba hu
She knows her -> hu knowa hu

Plural pronouns are made by duplicating the singular pronoun
we/us -> mumu ; you/your -> yuyu ; they/them -> huhu
We make a group -> mumu maka glopu
He takes them -> hu taka huhu

Possesives are made by replacing the last u of a pronoun with i
I see his problem -> mu sa hi ploblemu
They need your love -> huhu neda yi lobu

Adjectives end with i and are placed before nouns
I want good food -> mu wanta godi fodu
He has a big head -> hu haba bigi hedu

The prefix na expresses the opposite of a word
nagodi -> bad
nanigtu -> morning
nataka -> to give
nabigi -> small

Quantifiers (ni, mani, namani, ali)
all -> ali
no -> ni
many / very / much / a lot -> mani
few / some -> namani

All other i-words that are not placed before a noun are adverbs
The cat sleeps well -> ti katu slepa godi
The horse runs fast -> ti holsu luna fasti

Gender: You can precise the gender of a noun/pronoun with an adjective
he -> mali hu
she -> femi hu
father -> mali palentu
mother -> femi palentu

Number: Plurality can be expressed with "poly", but many adjectives can do it too
cat / cats -> katu
one cat -> one katu
several cats -> poli katu
many cats -> mani katu
no cat -> ni katu
all cats -> ali katu 
dogs -> poli dogu

Experimental! Fast plural: a fast way to express plurality is to put an additional u after a noun.
cat / cats -> katu
cats -> katuu
dogs -> doguu

Time: You can express the past (wasi) or the future (wili) with an adverb
I talked -> mu wasi talka
I will talk -> mu wili talka

Aspect: You can express that an action is ongoing (kepi) or completed (hadi) with an adverb
I ate -> mu wasi eta
I was eating -> mu wasi kepi eta
I had eaten -> mu wasi hadi eta
I will be eating -> mu wili kepi eta

Verbs in the passive voice end with e. It inverts the position of the subject and object.
A cat eats a fish -> katu eta fisu
A fish is eaten -> fisu ete
A fish is eaten by a cat -> fisu ete katu

Using the e-ending may replace some verbs in English.
The bird kills the mouse -> ti bildu kila ti mosu
The mouse is killed by the bird -> ti mosu kile ti bildu
The mouse dies by the bird -> to mosu kile ti bildu
A dog scares a cat -> dogu skala katu
A cat is afraid of a dog -> katu skale dogu

Verbs can be chained
You can use the map -> yu kana usa ti mapu
You must find the place -> yu musta finda ti plasu
A tool can be needed -> tolu kana nede

All other words except of numbers end with o. Prepositions.
I am in the train -> mu ba bo ti tlanu
I am out of the train -> mu ba nabo ti tlanu

Prepositions (note: "to go" and "to come" can be expressed with "to go" and a preposition)
I go to the town -> mu ga to ti townu
He comes from the town -> hu ga nato ti townu

Prepositions
He voted for you -> hu wasi bota folo yu
He voted against you -> hu wasi bota nafolo yu

Prepositions
The card is made of paper -> ti kaldu made ofo papelu
This is the bed of my cat -> ti ba ti bedu ofo mi katu

Prepositions
He is on the train -> hu ba bo ti tlanu
You are in the house -> yu ba bo ti hosu
I am at the station -> mu ba bo ti statinu
I am out of the station -> mu ba nabo ti statinu

Prepositions
next to the table -> nelo ti tablu
near the table -> nelo ti tablu
far from the table -> nanelo ti tablu

Prepositions
under the table -> downo ti tablu
on the table -> bo ti tablu
over the table -> upo ti tablu

Prepositions
with my friend -> wito mi flindu
with a tool -> wito tolu
without help -> nawito helpu

Prepositions
before the night -> waso ti nigtu
after the night -> wilo ti nigtu

Prepositions
behind the fence -> bako ti fensu
in front of the fence -> nabako ti fensu

Prepositions
because of the rain -> kaso ti lanu
until this day -> tilo ti dayu

Prepositions
instead of an apple -> instedo aplu
during the night -> dulingo ti nigtu
except the cat -> eksepto ti katu

Prepositions
according to him -> tinko hu
about him -> aboto hu
through him -> tlogo hu

Conjunctions end with o
an apple and an orange -> aplu ando olangu
an apple or an orange -> aplu olo olangu

Do-questions start with "do", they can be answered with "yeso" or "no"
Do I look pretty? -> do mu sema pleti?
Do you like sport? -> do yu lika spoltu?

Affirmation and negation
I do like sleeping! -> mu yeso lika slepa!
I don't like sleeping -> mu no lika slepa

Be sure to place "no" before the word you negate
Not me wants an apple -> no mu wanta aplu
I don't want an apple -> mu no wanta aplu
I want not an apple (but,) -> mu wanta no aplu

Wi-questions are made with "wi" and the tone. "wi" is placed before the word you are asking about. "wi" + the word is often moved to the start.
Which apple do you want? -> wi aplu yu wanta?
Who did you help? -> wi pelsonu yu wasi helpa?
When will you go? -> wi timi yu wili ga?
Where do you stay? -> wi plasi yu staya?

Numbers don't have a special ending, so they stay more distant from each other. When a number (0-9) does not end with a vowel, u is added.
selo, one, two, tle, folu, fibe, siksu, sebenu, egtu, nine, tenu, hundledu, tosandu

Big numbers
11 235 -> tenu one tosandu two hundledu tle tenu fibe
5 201 -> fibe tosandu two hundledu one 

Ordinal numbers are made by adding i
first -> onei
second -> twoi
third -> tlei

Some planned languages have a concept called "correlatives". They can be recreated in Heli using adjectives and nouns.
I see that thing -> mu sa ti tingu
I love this person -> mu loba ti pelsonu
I eat there -> mu eta ti plasi
I like this kind of cloth -> mu lika ti kindu ofo klotu
I walk for this reason -> mu walka ti kosi

Note: when you see "ti", "wi", "ali", "ni", "ani", "oteli" and other similar words without a word at the right, you can imagine the word "tingu" there.
Why do you study this? -> wi kosi yu studa ti?
How much do you want? -> wi kuntitu yu wanta?
It can sleep everywhere -> hu kana slepa ali plasi
How are you? -> wi maneli yu ba?
I never liked him -> mu ni timi lika hu

Content clause: the "that" used in English to link this kind of clause can be removed. In "mu want yu slepa", you can see "yu slepa" as the object of the verb "wanta".
I want that you sleep -> mu want yu slepa
He said that he will win -> hu wasi saya hu wili wina
You like that the language is easy -> yu lika ti langugu ba esi

Relative clause: they start with a comma and "wi". "wi" refers to something in the main clause, that is sometimes not explicitly written in English. You can see "ti" and "wi" as a bridge between the main clause and the relative clause.
I want (that,) what you have -> mu wanta (ti tingu), wi tingu yu haba
I am (there,) where you want -> mu ba (ti plasi), wi plasi yu wanta
I don't see (that,) what I can do -> mu no glaspa (ti tingu), wi tingu mu kana maka 

Relative clause 2: Be aware that in English, it is sometimes the "wi"-part that is not written. In Heli, the "wi"-part is always written, and the "ti"-part can be removed if the sentence stays understandable.
I love the person(, which person) you love -> mu loba (ti pelsonu), wi pelsonu yu loba
He broke the lamp(, what (lamp)) you made -> hu wasi bleka (ti lampu), wi lampu yu wasi maka

Participles are replaced by relative clauses
the cat, who is killing a bird -> ti katu, wi kila bildu
the bird-killing cat -> ti katu, wi kila bildu
the killer cat -> ti katu, wi kila
the killing cat -> ti katu, wi kila
the killed bird -> ti katu, wi kile

Actor of an action
a sleeper -> (tingu) wi slepa
a killer -> (tingu) wi kila
the cat is a killer -> ti katu ba wi kila

Vocabulary tips
1) Try to find if a more common word with the same meaning already exist (quick -> fast) https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/
2) Ask the community in Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/EjukbkmivHgrInfX_5nJ4A
3) Check on the dictionary: https://github.com/Vanege/Heli/blob/master/english%20-%3E%20heli
4) Try derivation:
- Change the ending of an already imported word (hapena -> hapenu)
- Try the prefix na- (fasti -> nafasti)
- Sometimes, it is simpler to use an adjective or an adverb next to an already existing word
5) Import from English. If the result is not good, try derivation again, or try importing from a synonym in English: http://www.thesaurus.com/
